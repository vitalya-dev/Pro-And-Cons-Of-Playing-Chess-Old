## Quick Start

#### Prerequisites

To ensure the use of a Node.js compatible with this package, we recommand to use the Node Version Manager ([nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)).

For OSX or Linux, just run in a terminal:
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.7/install.sh | bash
```

For Windows see [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

Then, in the root folder of the repository, run `nvm`. This will look for the .nvmrc file and install the proper version of Node.js for this package.

### About this branch (cef/dev)

The purpose of this branch is to maintain the Launcher's running into a Chrome Embedded Framework webview (CEF) loaded by
the Unity Editor.

The Launcher's [git flow](https://confluence.hq.unity3d.com/display/DEV/Hub+and+Launcher+Git+Flow#?lucidIFH-viewer-beaaf3b8=1) 
does not apply to this branch and every commit on it should be considered as
a hotfix and have an equivalent PR into Ono (see the section [Home Window development workflow](#home-window-development-workflow))

We branch for a editor version (e.g. 2017.2), either in the official release date or in case that there is a 
non-backward-compatible change needed for the under-development version.

#### Installation

Install script: 

```sh
# Clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:UnityTech/unityeditor-launcher.git

# Install global dependencies
$ npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower

$ cd unityeditor-launcher

$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt
```

The last grunt command will start a copy the required files in the dist folder and can be use for development purpose.  

#### Running Tests

```sh
$ grunt test
# This will generate a code coverage report. Instructions on viewing it are displayed in the result text.
```

#### Unity Javascript Package Repository

Unity now uses {UserData}/Packages/package.json to specify the required javascript packages

#### Home Window development workflow

The Home Window may be tested by linking a Unity editor repository to this project. It can be done by using the `npm link` 
command to instruct the editor to use your **unityeditor-launcher** repository as its `unity-editor-home` npm dependency.

The first step is to ensure your **unityeditor-launcher** package version matches the editor's `unity-editor-home` dependency 
version like below.

**unityeditor-launcher**'s package.json: 

```json
{
  "author": "Paolo Gavazzi - Unity",
  "name": "unity-editor-home",
  "version": "0.4.6-fix-XXXXXX",
  ...
}
```

{PathToUnityEditorRepo}/External/Packages/package.json:
```json
{
  "name": "unity-editor",
  "version": "5.3.0",
  "description": "Unity is a powerful cross-platform 3D engine ..",
  "author": "Unity Technologies",
  "dependencies": {
    "unity-editor-home": "0.4.6-fix-XXXXXX",
    ...
  }
}
```

If the versions differ follow these steps:

1. Update the Unity editor's package.json so that the `unity-editor-home` dependency's version matches your desired version.
2. Rebuild the editor (`perl build.pl b e`).
3. Update the **unityeditor-launcher**'s package.json so that the package version matches your desired version.

Once the versions match run the scripts below in order.

```sh
$ cd unityeditor-launcher

# Register your current project folder as the location of the unity-editor-home location
$ npm link

# Navigate to your Computer's "user data" directory for the Unity editor (in OSX: ~/Library/Unity).
$ cd {UserData}/Packages

# this creates a symbolic link to your dev folder for the unity-editor-home package
$ npm link unity-editor-home

$ grunt build    # to build ALL files
$ grunt watch    # to continuously update changes
```

Remember that OSX Sierra users need to prefix grunt commands with the `export` command as explained in the installation 
steps.

If there isn't a **dist** folder in the root the launcher will not run. Either run `grunt` or create a symbolic link with
the **build** folder in order to keep the source files unminified (`ln -s build dist`).

By running the editor from the Unity editor repository's build folder (`{PathToUnityEditorRepo}/build/MacEditor/Unity`) 
the Home Window from the **unityeditor-launcher** project should appear.

#### Debugging

To debug the Home Window, the [CEF Test App](https://cefbuilds.com/#branch_2062) may be used. Use the branch 2062's Mac 
32bit Test App.

Once downloaded and unzipped, run the **cefclient** file in the `Release` folder.

In the address bar, paste the url `http://localhost:9222/` and press Enter. If the Home Window is open (from previous 
section), a link labelled `Home` should be visible. After clicking it a Chrome Dev Tools window will appear.

#### Pull Request approval process

In order to be accepted, your PR to the "dev" branch must go through the same approval process as code that's commited to our Mercurial editor/collab/staging branch. Here are the steps to follow:

###### A. Prerequisites
0. Setup for checking out/committing to the Mercurial Unity repository: https://confluence.hq.unity3d.com/display/DEV/Development+Setup
0. Get access to our MyGet npm packages repository (ask @pgavazzi)

##### Create Pull Requests in both repositories

###### B. Create Pull Request in the unityeditor-launcher git repo:
0. Before submitting your PR, increment the version field in the package.json of each modified package to a prerelease version. The current convention to avoid overwriting other people's packages is to append the branch name as a prerelease tag.
    - For instance, if the current version is {"version": "0.0.16"} and your branch name is `my_awesome_fix`, update the version to {"version": "0.0.17-my_awesome_fix.1"}.
    - Version strings must be parseable by https://github.com/npm/node-semver.
0. Submit your PR. Travis will automatically publish packages that have a prerelease version to MyGet, and will skip publishing packages with release versions (it will still build them for verification purposes).
0. Add reviewers by mentioning them with @name in the description or a comment, including QA.
    - To make the notification emails stand out, it's highly recommended to cut down on the github spam by unwatching every repository and setting "Automatically watch repositories " to off in the Notification center. You'll still be notified when participating or @mentioned.
0. Download your prerelease packages from MyGet.

###### C. Create Pull Request in the unity mercurial repo:
0. Prepare a PR branch off editor/collab/staging. Copy the packages downloaded from MyGet into External/Packages, deleting older packages. Add the packages to mercurial as *largefiles* (`hg add --large`)
    - you can configure the largefiles extension to automatically consider .tgz as largefiles: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/LargefilesExtension#Overview.
0. Update External/Packages/package.json to depend on your new packages. For instance, if your package is `unityeditor-launcher.0.0.17-my_awesome_fix.1.tgz`, set {"unityeditor-launcher": "~0.0.17-my_awesome_fix.1"} in package.json.
    - For more info about npm's semantic versioning i.e. how npm actually matches what you put in package.json to ranges of package versions, see http://semver.npmjs.com/.
0. Push your branch and submit your PR on Ono. Ensure you follow all verification steps on your end, i.e. build, run all native tests, test likely affected areas in the editor, run the RAT, start Windows/Mac Editor Katana builds. Bring on reviewers and QA.
    - If you have used "npm link" to point the Unity editor to your javascript source, you need to delete those symlinks before launching Unity, or it won't install the packages you just produced.

If you need to update your PR, repeat the steps above as needed. You can choose to keep the same version number, which will overwrite your dev package on MyGet and save space, or increment it to generate new packages: `0.0.17-my_awesome_fix.2`, `0.0.17-my_awesome_fix.3`, and so on.

##### Final steps once both PRs are approved

For the merge to the git "dev" branch and the mercurial "editor/collab/staging" branch, your packages must be set back to release versions:

###### D. Produce release packages

0. *Ensure your git feature branch is up-to-date with the "dev" branch, or the version won't be updated correctly.* If not up-to-date, merge "dev" into your branch.
    - rebasing isn't advised at this point since for traceability, we don't want to lose the commit the tested packages came from.
0. Bump the version of each modified project by using `npm version patch` in their folder. The correct folder is the one containing the package.json.
    - `npm version patch` will bump `0.0.16 -> 0.0.17` and `0.0.17-my_awesome_fix.1 -> 0.0.17`
    - ensure that the result is that you're one patch version above the latest version used in "dev".
    - Note that **doesn't currently apply** to unityeditor-launcher: for packages that have their dedicated repo, `npm version` will automatically commit to your current branch and `git tag` the revision. In that case, in addition to pushing your commits, push the version tag using `git push origin <tag_name>` (info on pushing tags: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5195859/push-a-tag-to-a-remote-repository-using-git)
0. Update your GitHub PR and merge to "dev" branch.
    - The comment for the merge commit should be the URL of the pull request.
0. Travis will pick up your merge commit in the "dev" branch and upload new packages to MyGet. (Our Travis scripts will block release packages from being overwritten, so packages whose version did not change won't be reuploaded.)

###### E. Commit release packages

0. Download the release packages, commit them (as largefiles) to External/Packages in your Mercurial PR branch, replacing your prerelease ones. Update External/Packages/package.json accordingly to match the new version of your packages: `unityeditor-launcher.0.0.17.tgz` would require {"unityeditor-launcher": "~0.0.17"}.
0. Merge your PR branch to editor/collab/staging. Before pushing, ensure you build, run native tests, and ensure the editor can open a project. An additional sanity check is also recommended to ensure that the packages you're adding are the same (except for the version) as the prerelease ones you got tested by QA.
    - The comment for the merge commit should be the URL of the pull request.
